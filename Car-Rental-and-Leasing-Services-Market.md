The growth has been fueled by the rise in travel and tourism, as well as a growing urban population that favors shared mobility solutions. According to market reports, the market was valued at approximately $100 billion in 2023, with projections suggesting an upward trend in the coming years.</p>    <p>As urbanization continues to expand, more people are opting for car rentals and leases rather than owning vehicles outright, which contributes to this sector's growth. The rise of technologies such as mobile apps and online booking platforms has made it easier and more convenient for consumers to access these services, further propelling market dynamics. The global car rental and leasing services market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 7.2% from 2024 to 2032.</p>    <p>Market size estimates indicate that by 2024, the market could reach around $110 billion, escalating to about $170 billion by 2032. This growth trajectory is essential for stakeholders in the industry, as they adapt their strategies to cater to the evolving preferences of consumers. Factors such as enhanced customer experiences, online booking facilities, and the incorporation of electric vehicles are likely to gain traction in the upcoming years.</p>    <p>Furthermore, the adoption of subscription-based models for vehicle access is becoming increasingly popular, appealing to millennials and generation Z consumers who prioritize convenience over ownership. As corporate travel resumes post-pandemic, demand for leasing services is anticipated to surge, bolstering market growth. The adaptation of contactless services in response to consumer preferences for safety and convenience is also critical for the future of this market.</p>    <p><strong></strong></p>    <p>In terms of segments, the demand for luxury car rentals is on the rise, reflecting consumer willingness to spend on high-end experiences. This trend is expected to continue, particularly as the market adapts to meet the demands of a more affluent consumer base.
