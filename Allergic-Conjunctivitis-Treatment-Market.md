The expansion of healthcare infrastructure and accessibility to advanced therapies are contributing to this upward trend. As per industry reports, the market was valued at approximately <strong>$8 billion in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach around <strong>$12 billion by 2032</strong>, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.5% during this forecast period.</p>    <p>Consumer demand for effective treatment options has prompted key advancements in drug formulations, including the development of novel antihistamines and the introduction of combination therapies. These innovations are expected to enhance patient adherence to treatments and improve therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the growing trend towards self-medication is influencing the market, as patients increasingly seek accessible and effective over-the-counter solutions.</p>    <p><strong></strong></p>    <p>Emerging markets are anticipated to contribute significantly to market expansion, attributed to an increase in disposable income and rising urbanization. Healthcare initiatives focused on educating the population about allergic conjunctivitis are also enhancing treatment rates across various demographics. As the global population ages, the incidence of allergic conditions is expected to rise, further propelling market growth.</p>    <p>From a product perspective, the market is segmented into prescription medications and over-the-counter treatments. Prescription medications are expected to dominate the market; however, the over-the-counter segment is projected to witness rapid growth due to the convenience it offers to consumers.
